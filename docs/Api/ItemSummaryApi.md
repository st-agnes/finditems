This call performs an advanced search for items. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product Id (EPID), or gtin. Or a combination of these. Encoding Parameters and Headers As with all query parameter values, the fields parameter value and request header values must be URL encoded. For better readability, the examples in this document omit the encoding. Example: &nbsp;&nbsp;search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Encoded Example: &nbsp;&nbsp; search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId%3A20863%2CBrand%3A%7BNike%7CWilson%7D For more information about encoding, see HTML URL Encoding Reference The following are examples of using filters: The following call returns 4,330,774 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone This call, which limits the results to the category &quot;Cell Phones &amp; Smartphones&quot;, returns 142,098 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=9355 These calls, which limit results to a Samsung Galaxy S5, returns 97 items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=220&amp;epid=182527490 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid=182527490 Controlling what is returned You can also control what is returned by using the fieldgroups field. In addition to returning items, which is the default, you can return refinements (metadata) about an item that enables you to create aspect histograms. A histogram enables users to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. You can return: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by variation aspects, such as Brand, Color, etc. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by either FIXED_PRICE or AUCTION CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - Lets shoppers refine the result set by items in a category CONDITION_REFINEMENT - Lets shoppers refine the result set by item condition, such as NEW, USED, etc. MATCHING_ITEMS - The default, which returns the items. When used with one or more of the refinement values above the specified refinements and all the matching items are returned. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Filtering by aspects You can use the aspect refinements returned to filter the result set using the aspect_filter field. For example: This call gets a list of the aspects pairs for the item and the dominant category (category most of the items are in). /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS This call filters the items by one of the aspect pairs returned and the dominant category ( categoryId is required when using aspect_filter) /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas} This call filters the items by multiple aspects /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{adidas},Featured Refinements:{Adidas Match Ball} This call filters the items by multiple aspect values /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=world cup soccer ball&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:20863,Brand:{Nike|Wilson} Additional filters There are also multiple filters you can use to refine the result set, such as listing format, item condition, price range, listing end date, location, and more. You can use multiple filters in a single call. For a list and details of the supported filters, see search Call Field Filters. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls ( limit and offset fields) and sort query parameter that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this call. If you are an eBay Network Partner you must use affiliateCampaignId=ePNCampaignId,affiliateReferenceId=referenceId in the header in order to be paid for selling eBay items on your site and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improved the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buy APIs Overview. Restrictions For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions. Limitation: This call can return a maximum of 10,000 items.

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: Client Credentials
$config = Swagger\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

$apiInstance = new Swagger\Client\Api\ItemSummaryApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.

    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$aspect_filter = "aspect_filter_example"; // string | The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, to use to limit the results. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. For example, the call below uses the category Id for Women's Clothing. This will return only items for a woman's red shirt. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;aspect_filter=categoryId:15724,Color:{Red} To get a list of the aspects pairs and the category, which is returned in the dominantCategoryId field, set fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=shirt&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Required: categoryId:categoryId-value For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/AspectFilter.html
$category_ids = "category_ids_example"; // string | The category Ids to use to limit the results. This field can have one category Id or a comma separated list of Ids. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GET https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids=29792 Note: Currently, you can pass in only one category Id. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids, epid, and q fields. This gives you additional control over the result set. For example, let's say you are looking of a toy phone. If you search for &quot;phone&quot;, the result set will be mobile phones because this is the &quot;Best Match&quot; for this search. But if you also include the toy category Id, the results will be what you wanted. For example: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GET https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&amp;category_ids=220 The list of eBay category Ids is not published and category Ids are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site. Use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Categories for Buy API Calls. Submit the following call to get the dominantCategoryId for an item. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=keyword&amp;fieldgroups=ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Note: If a top-level (L1) category is specified, you must also include the q query parameter. Required: The call must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)

$fieldgroups = "fieldgroups_example"; // string | This field lets you control what is to be returned in the response. The default is MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms. For code examples see, aspect_filter. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the dominantCategoryId, matchCount, and refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for 'Mustang', some of the aspect would be Model Year , Exterior Color , Vehicle Mileage , etc. Note: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions container, which has the matchCount and refinementHref for AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items. Note: Classified items are not supported. CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in. CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions container, such as NEW, USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example, New can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc. MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items.
